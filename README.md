Performance comparison of using Unity 2D Physics vs 3D Physics with 2D sprites in Futile

The purpose of this project is to illustrate the performance difference between using 3D rigidbody/colliders and 2D rigidbody/colliders with Futile.

The game will start with a solid border of square tiles and then fill in circle/spere colliders. The game starts in 3D mode. Press "R" to restart it in 2D mode (and again to flip back to 3D mode).

The 2d/3d code is as close to analogous as possible.
